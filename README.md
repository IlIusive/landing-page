 This project is a webpage created from a reference image provided by my chosen curriculum, The Odin Project. It's intent is to demonstrate my skills with HTML, CSS and Flexbox.

I utilized the following programs to help create and push this to Github

– Linux + Command Terminal
– Visual Studio Code
– and The Odin Project for continual reference.
